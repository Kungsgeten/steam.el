* Steam.el

  Use the power of emacs and org-mode to sort and search your Steam
  library. Also includes functionality to launch games from Emacs.

** Installation

   Add steam.el to your load-path. Add the following to your init-file:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'steam)
     (setq steam-username "Username") ;; Replace Username with your steam username
   #+end_src

** Usage

   - To launch a game: =M-x steam-launch=
   - To insert your game list in org format: =M-x steam-insert-org=
   - To update your game list (if you've installed new games without
     restarting Emacs): =M-x steam-get-games=
