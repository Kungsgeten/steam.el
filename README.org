#+TITLE:Steam.el [[http://melpa.org/#/steam][file:http://melpa.org/packages/steam-badge.svg]]

  Use the power of emacs and org-mode to sort and search your Steam
  library. Also includes functionality to launch Steam games from Emacs.

* Installation

   The easiest way is to install =steam.el= from MELPA. Then add the following to your init-file:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq steam-username "Username") ;; Replace Username with your steam username
   #+end_src

* Usage

   - To launch a game: =M-x steam-launch=
   - To insert your game list in org-mode format: =M-x steam-insert-org-text=
   - Download logotypes for your games, and insert them into org-mode: =M-x steam-insert-org-images=
   - To update your game list (if you've installed new games without
     restarting Emacs): =M-x steam-get-games=
     
   In org-mode, you can click links in order to run your games. This
   will bring up a pop-up, asking if it is safe to run the lisp-code.
   If this annoys you, put this line at the top of your .org-file: 
   =#-*- org-confirm-elisp-link-function: nil; -*-=

   If you insert the logotype images into org-mode, make sure to turn
   on =org-display-inline-images=. You can also put
   =#+STARTUP:inlineimages= at the top of your .org-file.
