;;; Commentary:

;; Launch games in your Steam library from Emacs.  First set your `steam-username':
;;
;; (setq steam-username "your_username")
;;
;; Then use `steam-launch' to play a game! You can also insert your steam
;; library into an org-mode file, in order to organize your games, and launch
;; them from there.  Run either `steam-insert-org-text' or
;; `steam-insert-org-images' (if you want the logotypes for the games in your
;; org file). The logotypes will be saved locally (see variable `steam-logo-dir'
;; into a folder relative to the org-file.
